## 🔬 Scientific Approach

### **Wave Power Physics**
- **Formula**: P = (ρ × g² / 64π) × H² × T
- **Variables**: Significant wave height (H), peak period (T), seawater density (ρ)
- **Output**: Wave power flux in W/m for energy resource assessment

### **Validation Strategy**
- **Copernicus Data**: Satellite observations provide ground truth for model validation
- **NOAA Reforecast**: 20-year model climatology enables seasonal/interannual analysis  
- **Cross-Validation**: Temporal splits preserve time series structure for forecasting

### **Target Performance Metrics**
- **Phase 1**: 5-10% RMSE improvement over persistence baseline
- **Phase 2**: 15-20% improvement with ensemble methods
- **Phase 3**: 25-30% improvement with advanced ML architectures
